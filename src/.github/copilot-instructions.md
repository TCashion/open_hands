This repository contains a fullstack Tic Tac Toe project with a React + TypeScript frontend and a Python FastAPI backend. When contributing, follow these guidelines:

- Frontend is located in `frontend/` and uses Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit.
- Backend is located in `backend/` and uses FastAPI and SQLModel with SQLite.
- Keep changes small and focused. Write clear commit messages.
- Tests (if added) should be in `tests/` and use pytest for backend and Jest for frontend.
